<p>I grew up just North of the GTA, in a town called Uxbridge, Ontario. I moved to Toronto to study Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, 
    and to pursue work in the software industry. In my free time you can find me working in the lab, trying out a pet project, or taking to
    the rink to figure skate. One thing that I really love about the work I do, and part of the reason that it can dominate so much of my 
    schedule without it driving me insane, is that there is so much variety to it. I can be working directly on an operating system or firmware
    one day, and then be working to make beautiful visualizations of data analysis the next. It's a new problem in a new area every day!
