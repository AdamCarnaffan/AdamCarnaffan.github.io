Welcome again! I'm really excited that you're here and that I can share my interests with you. For anything more pertanent to any of our potential shared interests, check out some of my other posts. Here I will give you some background on who I am, what I get up to, and what I enjoy.

## Who am I?

I am a 19 year old living in Toronto. When I'm not in school, I'm either programming or I'm engaging in what social life my busy schedule allows. 

## My Interests

Though my interests are many, my time is short, as is yours, I'd assume. As a result, I'd like to take the time to talk only about the most dominant interests in my life and the things that make me happiest. Beyond that, I hope that my posts over time will give a deeper insight into some of my more particular interests. 

### Device Networking

Networking has been an interest of mine since 2015. I started in router technologies rooting routers and manipulating them at the lower level, customizing the firmware and compiling it from scratch. After a while I began to look at *IoT* technologies and what I could do with them. There is a vast freedom in interfacing different devices and there are a ton of options in today's age for doing so. Almost all devices now require a connection to some form of network to function at full capacity, and an improvement in this field could mean a life-change for next generation devices.

### User Experience Design & Software Accessibility

I have found interest in the design of user interface and the experience of the user with software since a QA position I held over the summers of 2017 & 2018. I find that using any application has a certain experience attached to it, and that will, in part, determine whether or not a user continues to use something that I may develop. As a result, I'm always very conscious of how I can improve the experience of anyone using any software, whether it be through plugins, modifications or the creation of a new tool.

### Figure Skating

I've been a figure skater since 2007. I have a passion for getting out onto the ice, expressing myself in my motions and getting active. It is one thing that I do that is more physically than mentally stimulating, and it can be a nice break from other aspects of my life. It can give me a chance to just go out and have fun, keep active, and process all of the information I've recently taken in through work and school.

## Education in Engineering

I am enrolled in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. I am in my second year as of now, working my way through second semester. There are a number of reasons that I think that engineering is a good fit for me. More than anything though, I have a great appreciation for the method by which engineers approach problems. Even though a single problem may be approached from many facets by many different kinds of experts, the engineering approach is the one I've always found returns the best outcome for my way of thinking.

### Why Engineering Science?

Of all engineering disciplines, I chose to pursue Engineering Science. The program description on the university website says

> Engineering Science is separate from the other Engineering programs at the University of Toronto. The Engineering Science program has a unique “2+2” curriculum structure, namely a 2-year foundation curriculum followed by a 2-year specialization curriculum. In the first two years, students develop a strong foundation in both engineering and science. Students then select one of eight Majors (Aerospace, Biomedical Systems, Electrical & Computer, Energy Systems, Machine Intelligence, Mathematics, Statistics & Finance, Physics or Robotics) to focus on in their final two years.

Basically, for me the draw to Engineering Science comes from the broad spectrum of knowledge and experience that the program provides. Above that, I feel that the network of amazing people that I have met and continue to meet in my program is an indisputable case for the program.
